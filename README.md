# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
The purpose of this challenge is to build upon our current understanding of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and how they dynamically interact with each other through the application of 3rd-party APIs such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.  By creating a functionable workday scheduler, we are practicing how to use these tools in a practical mode.

The first obstacle was making sure that the stylesheet and javaScript files were properly synced to the HTML. That was a nice little curveball at the beginning of this challenge. It was also important to take note of the classes and IDs that were already in place for us to use. 

Going down the "Acceptance Criteria", the first task required the usage of Moment.js to ensure that the current day is always displayed at the top. Next, I utilized Bootstrap to help me create the time blocks for the different hours of the day.  Then, I had to combine the abilties of both Moment.js and Bootstrap in order to properly color-code the blocks based on the time.
