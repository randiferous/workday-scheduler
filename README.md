# Work Day Scheduler
The purpose of this challenge is to build upon our current understanding of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and how they dynamically interact with each other through the application of 3rd-party APIs such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.  By creating a functionable workday scheduler, we are conditioning ourselves to use these tools in a practical mode.

The first obstacle was making sure that the stylesheet and javaScript files were properly synced to the HTML. That was a nice little curveball at the beginning of this challenge. It was also important to take note of the classes and IDs that were already in place for us to use. 

Going down the "Acceptance Criteria", the first task required the usage of Moment.js to ensure that the current day is always displayed at the top. Next, I utilized Bootstrap to help me create the time blocks for the different hours of the day.  Then, I had to combine the abilties of Moment.js, Bootstrap, and jQuey in order to properly color-code the blocks based on the time.

Creating and saving an event was the difficult part of this challenge. Understanding the concept of DOM traversal and how to apply that understanding through jQuery was the key to linking each button with their corresponding timeblocks.  Like in the previous challenge, we had to properly set information to Local Storage and then extract that information back onto the webpage. It was important for me to practice this process, as I struggled with it in the previous challenge. Here, being careful with my syntax was the main focus.

What I appreciate about this challenge is that it forced me to research documentation of various third-party APIs. Even though I did not use most of what I read about, I still found it informative to expand my knowledge of what these APIs are capable of.
